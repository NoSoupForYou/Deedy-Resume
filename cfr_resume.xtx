% IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
%
% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.
%

%
% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Known Issues:
% 1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the

\begin{tightemize}

\item Took over lead development of \textbf{jobqueue}, an event-based distributed system to process the sanitization, storage,
and QA of servicer data for over 60,000 securities and growing. Introduced ZeroMQ to change it from a polling
system on one machine to an event-driven network of up to 196 nodes with real-time job control. Wrote the system CLI
and trained 5 analysts in its use. Wrote and maintained the job API facing analyst and business teams.

\item Led development of \textbf{remitscript2}, a YAML-based language for extraction of financial data from XLS, PDF,
and TXT files in dozens of individual formats. Coordinated with a team of 50 analysts in NYC and Shanghai to develop
version-controlled extraction scripts for over 60,000 securities from 25 servicers worldwide.

\item Wrote \textbf{testscript2}, a distributed, test-driven Extraction, Transform, and Load system designed to update
information monthly on all available mortgage securities. Wrote a data QA framework integrated with \textbf{jobqueue} using
ZeroMQ, Git, and Jenkins and trained a team of analysts in writing, QAing, and deploying new tests.

\item Led continuing development of \textbf{SixPoint}, a tool which translates procedural CDI payment scripts
into a custom format in YAML using PyPEG and NumPY. Ported 2000 securities over to a new cashflow engine and
wrote a suite of simulation tests to asses translation quality.

\item Worked on \textbf{loanscript2}, a 3+TB SQLite/MongoDB database of all historical mortgage loan data in the United States.
Designed and implemented a statistical method to detect incorrect or incomplete data, in addition to a numerical approach to
"filling in" missing pieces of data to use in cashflow projections.
