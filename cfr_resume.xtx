% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.

% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)

\descript{| Financial Software Engineer}
\location{July 2011 - November 2014 | New York, NY}
\begin{tightemize}

\item Took over lead development of \textbf{jobqueue}, an event-based distributed system to process the sanitization, storage,
and QA of servicer data for over 60,000 securities and growing. Introduced ZeroMQ to improve redundancy and scale up to a
network of up to 196 nodes with real-time job control.

\item Led development of \textbf{remitscript2}, a YAML-based language for extraction of financial data from XLS, PDF,
and TXT files in dozens of individual formats. Coordinated with a team of 50 analysts in NYC and Shanghai to develop
version-controlled extraction scripts for over 60,000 securities from 25 servicers worldwide.

\item Worked on \textbf{loanscript2}, a 3+TB SQLite/MongoDB database of all historical mortgage loan data in the United
States and the code which generates new monthly data from various sources, made available to engine and business teams
and terminal clients. Designed and implemented a statistical method to detect incorrect or incomplete loan data, in addition
to a numerical approach to "filling in" missing pieces of data to use in cashflow projections.
